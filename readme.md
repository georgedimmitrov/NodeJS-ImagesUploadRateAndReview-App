## NodeJS Photos Application

This app was made for purely personal use in the process of me learning Node, so please excuse all the dumb stuff in it.
The technology stack used includes:
Express.js, Pug and MongoDB.

For the time being the app saves the uploaded picture in the /public/uploads directory and serves them from there.

To start the app simply:
1. clone this repo
2. npm install/yarn
3. rename 'variables.env.example' to 'variables.env' and put in your DB and generate your google maps api key (its free)
3. npm start
4. go to http://localhost:7777 in your favourite browser
